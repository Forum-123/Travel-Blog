                        <p>Filled with diverse cultures and different religions, India is a home to a number of festivals, with festive spirit present in people's hearts and souls. Accompanied with special dishes, sweets and lights, the festivities transcent all limitations and spread sheer along all. Here is a list of festivals I experienced during my time exploring the country.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Raksha Bandhan</p>
                        <p>Over the years since the Vedic times, Raksha Bandhan has become a popular festival all over India. It is celebrated as a festival signifying the loving bond between a brother and a sister. Raksha Bandhan falls on the full moon day in the month of Shravan (July-August).</p>
                        <p>The brother sits on a wooden stool and his sister decorates a thali (plate) with a rakhi (sacred thread), tikka made of turmeric and vermillon and some mithai (sweet dish). She ties the thread, praying for her brother's health and prosperity. Her brother, in turn, promises to protect her throughout his life and gives her a gift or some money.</p>
                        <p>Markets were filled with dazzling rakhis and shop counters were packed with a variety of mithais.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Janmashtami</p>
                        <p>Janmashtami is a festival celebrating the birth of Lord Krishna. This day falls on the eighth day of Krishna Paksha (a lunar fortnight) in the month of Bhadrapad (August-September) It is celebrated in states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and other northern states.</p>
                        <p>Devotees of Lord Krisha observe a fast and meditate on this day, to still all senses so that the divine Lord can show his presence. An ideol of Krishna in his baby form is kept in a cradle and the devotees take turns pulling its string to rock the baby Krishna.</p>
                        <p>Since Lord Krishna loved milk and curd, a game called Dahi Handi is played. A large clay pot is filled with milk, curd, honey, butter and fruits is hung at an inaccessible height. Young boys and men come forward to try and reach the handi, by forming a human pyramid until they have reached the pot. Others splash water and cheer, trying to make the task of the climbers as difficult as possible. The victory of good over evil is celebrated in this colourful and vibrant festival.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Gurpurab</p>
                        <p>Gurpurab is an important Sikh festival, which occur ten times in a year. Each Gurpurab marks either the birth, death or suffering of a Sikh Guru. The most significant Gurpurab is that of the birth anniversary of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It is also called Guru Nanak Jayanti and is celebrated in the month of Kartik (November).</p>
                        <p>The Sikh flag flies at the head of the procession and people flock to the Gurudwaras. After offering prayers, there is a community lunch, called langar.</p>
                        <p>Sikhs distribute the traditional Karah Prasaad or halwa to everyone on this day. Homes and Gurudwaras are brightly lit up in the evening. The main places of worship are the Guru Nanaka Sahib in Pakistan and the Golden Temple in Amritsar.</p>
