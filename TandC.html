            understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on
            behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to
            this Agreement, in which case the terms &quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; shall refer to
            such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you
            must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that
            this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not
            physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.</p>
        <h4>Accounts and membership</h4>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Website and Services. By using the Website and Services and

            you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in
            connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign
            in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the
            termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any
            other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of
            any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>

            obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion,
            violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Unless specifically permitted by
            you, your use of the Website and Services does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify,
